next steps:

- store the results of generated files in folders based on the parameters
- analyze each folder and choose the best one
- run the original file through a voice recognition filter to filter out the prompter
- run tuning again on the filtered output
- either use google's speech recognition API to recognize each file or generate my own voice recognition system using training data
